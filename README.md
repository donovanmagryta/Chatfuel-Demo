# Chatfuel-Demo
PHP code for chatbot's backend server.

Demo chatbot has three modes; Class, Admin, and Smart FAQ. In Class mode, users can follow step-by-step tutorials. In Admin mode, an admin can program the bot right from inside the chat, conversationally. In Smart FAQ mode, users can ask the bot questions which the chatbot can answer. If the chatbot is stumped, it will defer to forward the question to a human customer service rep via email who can step in. This acts as a screener and eases customer service labor.

The purpose of this chatbot is for automated marketing. The chatbot sells itself and advertises chatbot development services unintrusively, pitching the benefits of chatbots through an instant, interactive demo as opposed to a sales lecture.
